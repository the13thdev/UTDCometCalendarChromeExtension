# UTD Comet Calendar Chrome Extension

A chrome extension that displays events on University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) campus for the current date.

It fetches data from the UTD Comet Calendar website (https://www.utdallas.edu/calendar) every midnight, stores it locally, and displays it inside the extension for easy access.
